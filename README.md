#  Star Ships

## A simple app that calls an API to retrieve a list of star ships. This utilises best practices such as...
* Documenting architecture in code
* Documentation comments for all structures and classes
* Using loadable patterns for data that requires waiting
* Async-await for asynchronous operations.
