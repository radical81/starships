#  Use Heart for Favourite
#### 3 March 2024
---

### Status
Initial implementation.

### Context
The initial default way of implementing favourite indicators.

### Decision
The simplicity and commonality of using the heart to mark a favourite, and the heart with slash to un-mark a favourite, seems user-intuitive.

### Consequences
This keeps things simple to the user, with the heart as a toggle button.
